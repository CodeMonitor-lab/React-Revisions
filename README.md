- **TailwindCSS** – A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling elements without writing custom CSS.
- **CSS Modules** – Enables scoped and modular CSS, keeping styles isolated to specific components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern syntax and features to write cleaner and more efficient code.
- **HTML5** – The foundational markup language for structuring web content.
- **CSS** – A style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of HTML elements on a web page.
- **Vite** – A lightning-fast frontend build tool and dev server (used instead of Create React App).

### ⚙️ Development Tools

- **NPM / Yarn** – Node package managers for installing dependencies and managing project scripts.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control system and platform for hosting and collaborating on code.
- **ESLint & Prettier** – Tools for code linting and formatting to maintain a clean, consistent codebase.
- **VS Code** – A powerful, extensible code editor for development.

### 🌐 Web APIs & Browser Features

- **Fetch API / Axios** – For making HTTP requests to fetch or send data to/from an API.
- **LocalStorage / SessionStorage** – For storing data in the browser to persist state across sessions.

### 🧪 Testing
